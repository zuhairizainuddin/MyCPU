# MyCPU
This repo is to store the external files related to the android app project first built for department of psychiatry, Hospital Tawau.

This repo does not contain the actual code or the business logic of the codes. It only contains certain data to cater for specific locality.

For now, for each areas utilisting MyCPU have their own repo for storing their own data. These data will be fetched by the MyCPU app to be used locally in their respective areas.

For example, those using MyCPU app in Tawau area will use the data from Tawau database (this repo), and those from Kota Kinabalu will use their own repo as well.

In future, we can use firebase but for now we will only use github as it is simple (for small datasets).
